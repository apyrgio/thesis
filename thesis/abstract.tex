	The storage service of a cloud infrastracture is a very performance 
	critical part. Hard disks are usually inadequate in providing the 
	performance that is needed for large deployments and the storage 
	engineers must commonly resort to other ways to counter these issues.  
	This thesis presents cached, an in-memory caching mechanism with 
	average O(1) complexity, that aims to improve the performance of 
	Archipelago, a distributed storage service.  Moreover, this thesis also 
	introduces synapsed, a complementary tool that paves the way for the 
	creation of a fully distributed cache. Early performance evaluations 
	look promising and show that cached can provide up to 400\% speedup 
	over the current Archipelago performance.
