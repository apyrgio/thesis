\chapter{Implementation of cached}\label{ch:cached-implementation}

In the previous chapter, we presented a design overview for cached and its 
components. In this chapter we will blabla how the above design has been
implemented and explain in depth the structures and functions that have been 
created for this purpose.

More specifically, sections ? - ? provide implementation information for the 
components of cached, as described in Chapter ?. Next, section ? presents the 
actual initialization and blabla operations using excerpts from the code.

\section{Implementation of xcache}

In this section, we describe how we implemented the design concept of section 
\ref{sec:xcache-design}. The main \xcache structure is the following:

\ccode{Main \xcache struct}{xcache-struct.h}

Each of the above \xcache struct fields serves a design purpose.
Let's see which fields help in what:

\subsection{Entry Preallocation}

The relevant fields for this purpose can be seen in the following code listing:

\ccode{\xcache struct fields for preallocated entries}{xcache-prealloc.h}

and the definition of the \texttt{xcache entry} struct which shows up in 
\texttt{xcache} struct can be seen below:

\ccode{\texttt{xcache entry} struct}{xcache-entry.h}

Let's start by listing what \texttt{xcache entry} consists of. First of all, it 
must have a name. Since we preallocate the entries and cannot know in runtime 
their length, we must allocate as much space as possible. The \texttt{char 
	name[XSEG\_MAX\_TARGETLEN + 1]} field, which is 256 characters long, is 
long enough to hold the target's name. Also, as we have mentioned in Section 
\ref{sec:entry-prealloc-design}, xcache must be agnostic of the cache contents.  
To this end, we use the generic \texttt{void *priv} field as a pointer to the 
actual entry content. The rest of the fields will be explained in the following 
chapters.

Let's continue now with the fields of Listing \ref{lst:xcache-prealloc.h}. Since 
we preallocate the entries using \texttt{malloc}, they take up a contiguous 
space in memory.  The start of this space is the where the \texttt{*nodes} field 
points to. The \texttt{free\_nodes} field works similarly to the free\_entries 
field in Section \ref{sec:get-req-archip} i.e. it is a stack where indexes to 
unused nodes are pushed. These indexes will be seen in various code excerpts in 
this chapter and have a specific name, 
\texttt{xcache\_handler}\footnote{\#define xcache\_handler uint64\_t}.

\subsection{Entry Indexing}

The relevant fields for this purpose can be seen in the following code listing:

\ccode{xcache struct fields for entry indexing}{xcache-index.h}

As we have mentioned in Section \ref{sec:xcache-index-design}, we utilize two 
hash tables, one for the cached entries and one for the former cached entries 
(or evicted entries or removed entries). These hash tables can be accessed from 
the \texttt{xcache struct} and are \texttt{*entries} and \texttt{*rm\_entries} 
respectively.

These are the functions which are related to indexing and \xcache exposes to the 
peer function:

\ccode{Indexing functions}{xcache-index.c}

All of these function need a pointer to the \xcache struct. Here's a brief 
description of them:

\begin{description}
	\item[xcache\_lookup:]
		Takes the target's name as an argument and searches for it in 
		cache.\\
		Returns on failure: NoEntry\footnote{\#define NoEntry 
			(xcache\_handler)-1}\\
		Returns on success: the requested handler.\\
		\textbf{Note:} Looks only in \texttt{entries}.
	\item[xcache\_insert:]
		Takes the handler of an allocated entry as an argument and uses 
		it to index that entry.\\
		Returns on failure: NoEntry.
		Returns on success:
		\begin{inparaenum}[\itshape a\upshape)]
		\item the same handler or
		\item another one, if this entry already exists in cache.
		\end{inparaenum}
		\textbf{Note:} It looks up first if the entry exist in 
		\texttt{entries} or \texttt{rm\_entries}. The later case can 
		lead to re-insertions.
	\item[xcache\_remove:]
		Takes the handler of an allocated entry as an argument and uses 
		it to remove that entry.\\
		Returns on failure: -1.
		Returns on success: 0.
		\textbf{Note:} Removes entries only from \texttt{entries} hash 
		table.
	\item[xcache\_invalidate:]
		An \texttt{xcache\_remove} spin-off. Takes the name of the entry 
		as an argument, looks it up and then removes it
		Returns on failure: -1.
		Returns on success: 0.
		\textbf{Note:} Unlike remove, entries can either be on 
		\texttt{entries} or \texttt{rm\_entries} hash table.
\end{description}

\subsection{Entry eviction}

The relevant fields for this purpose can be seen in the following code listing:

\ccode{\xcache struct fields for eviction}{xcache-evict.h}

As we have mentioned in Section \ref{sec:xcache-evict-design}, we resort to 
eviction when the cache is full and new entries can't be inserted. This entry is 
the Least Recently Used entry. The doubly-linked list we maintain for this end 
can be seen below:

\ccode{Doubly-linked LRU list}{xcache-dlist.h}

Lets explain these fields a bit:

\begin{description}
	\item[lru:] Obviously, it's the least recently used entry. It can be 
		considered as the one end of the doubly linked list.
	\item[mru:] The entry that has just been used. It can be considered as 
		the other end of the doubly-linked list
	\item[younger:] This entry-specific field points to an entry used right 
		after our entry was used.
	\item[older:] Same as "younger", it points to the entry that has been 
		used right before our entry was used.
\end{description}

Finally, as we have explained in Section \ref{sec:xcache-evict-design}, the 
eviction internals should normally not bother the user. However, if the user 
wants to, \xcache provides the exposes the following functions:

\begin{description}
	\item[xcache\_evict\_lru:] The name says it all, it evicts the recently 
		used item.
	\item[xcache\_peek\_and\_get\_lru:] This function allows the user to 
		atomically take a peek on the Least Recently Used entry and also 
		update its refcount.
\end{description}

\subsection{Concurrency control}\label{sec:conc-imp}

\paragraph{Locking}\label{par:lock}

\paragraph{Reference counting}\label{par:refcount-imp}

The refcount model in xcache should be familiar to most people:

% Turn this to figure
\begin{itemize}
	\item When an entry is inserted in cache, the cache holds a reference 
		for it (ref = 1).
	\item Whenever a new lookup for this cache entry succeeds, the reference 
		is increased by 1 (ref++)
	\item When the request that has issued the lookup has finished with an 
		entry, the reference is decreased by 1. (ref--)
	\item When a cache entry is evicted by cache, the its ref is decreased 
		by 1. (ref--)
\end{itemize}

Some common refcount cases are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item active entry with pending jobs (ref > 1)
	\item active entry with no pending jobs (ref = 1)
	\item evicted entry with pending jobs (ref > 0)
	\item evicted entry with no pending jobs (ref = 0)
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[tbp]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | }
		\hline
		Case & Refcount \\ \hline \hline
		active entry with pending jobs & ref > 1 \\ \hline
		active entry with no pending jobs & ref = 1 \\ \hline
		evicted entry with pending jobs & ref > 0 \\ \hline
		evicted entry with no pending jobs & ref = 0 \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Reference counting of xcache}
	\label{tab:refcount}
\end{table}

and, as always, the entry is freed only when its ref = 0.
