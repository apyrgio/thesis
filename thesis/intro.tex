\section{Thesis structure}

\fixme Fix the summary and references of these chapters.

% TODO: Make `Chapter x` click-able and anchored to the respective chapter
\begin{description}
\item[Chapter~\ref{ch:ch2}:]
We define what "cloud" means and mention some of the most notable examples.
Then, we give a brief overview of the synnefo implementation, its key
characteristics and why it can have a place in the current cloud world.
\item[Chapter~\ref{ch:archipelago}:]
We present the architecture of Archipelago and provide the necessary 
theoretical background (mmap, IPC) the reader needs to understand its basic 
concepts. Then, we thoroughly explain how Archipelago handles I/O requests.  
Finally, we mention what are the current storage mechanisms for Archipelago and 
evaluate their performance.
\item[Chapter~\ref{ch:tiering}:]
We explain why tiering is important and what is the state of tiered storage at
the moment (bcache, flashcache, memcached, ramcloud, couchbase).  Then, we
provide the related theoretical background for cached (hash-tables, LRUs).
Finally, we defend why we chose to roll out our own implementation.
\item[Chapter~\ref{ch:cached-design}:]
We explain the design of cached, the building blocks that is consisted of
(xcache, xworkq, xwaitq). Then, we give some examples that illustrate the 
operation under different scenarios
\item[Chapter~\ref{ch:cached-implementation}:]
We present the cached implementation, the structures that have been created and 
the functions that have been used.
\item[Chapter~\ref{ch:cached-evaluation}:]
We explain how cached was evaluated and present benchmark results.
\item[Chapter~\ref{ch:synapsed}:]
It connects brain parts. And its tale must be told.
\item[Chapter~\ref{ch:ch7}:]
We draw some concluding remarks and propose some future work.
